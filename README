BerryBots is a programming game. A player programs a ship that moves around the
stage, sees gameplay events, and shoots at other ships. The ship API and game
rules are simple and it's easy to get started in just a few minutes.

The stage is also configured and controlled by a program, so the gameplay on
every stage is different. The sample stages include mazes, jousting, a race
track, several classic arcade style games, and a few battle stages. These only
scratch the surface of what can be done with the stage API, but you could stay
busy for quite a while just writing ships for the sample stages.

Ships and stages are written in Lua, a fast, lightweight, flexible programming
language designed to be embedded into other programs. BerryBots is currently
available for the Raspberry Pi, Mac, and Linux.
