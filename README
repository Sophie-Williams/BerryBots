BerryBots is a programming game. A player programs a ship that moves around the
stage, sees gameplay events, and (possibly) shoots at other ships. The ship API
and game rules are simple and it's easy to get started in just a few minutes.

The stage is also configured and controlled by a program, so the gameplay on
every stage is different. The sample stages include mazes, jousting, a race
track, a targeting challenge, several classic arcade style games, and a few
battle stages. These only scratch the surface of what can be done with the stage
API, but you could stay busy for quite a while just writing ships for the sample
stages.

Ships and stages are written in Lua, a lightweight, flexible programming
language designed to be embedded into other programs. BerryBots is currently
available for Mac, Linux, Windows, and Raspberry Pi.
